# Escalation & Response

Continuous escalation model and counter-terror operations.

---

## 22. Escalation Model

### Facility Posture States

```
Normal Ops → Suspicion → Incident → Lockdown → Counter-Terror Event → Stabilization → Recovery
```

### Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Escalation Level |
|---------|------------------|
| Camera anomaly | Suspicion |
| Badge misuse | Suspicion |
| Forced door | Incident |
| Shots fired | Incident → Lockdown |
| Hostage confirmed | Counter-Terror Event |
| Bodies discovered | Lockdown |
| Device planted/detected | Counter-Terror Event |
| Terminal/audit anomalies | Suspicion → Incident |

### What Changes When It Goes Hot

| System | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Doors | Seal by ring, mantraps activate |
| Patrols | Redeploy to containment |
| Staff | Shelter, panic, comply, silent alarm |
| IT | Log review, camera focus, door warfare |
| Response | Elites/QRF/CT arrive (doctrine-dependent) |
| Lighting | Emergency mode, restricted zones |
| PA | Announcements, lockdown warnings |

### De-Escalation

Possible in limited cases:
- Wipe logs
- Restore power
- Remove evidence
- Clear suspicion through time

**Major events (hostage, confirmed hostile) usually remain hot until resolved.**
