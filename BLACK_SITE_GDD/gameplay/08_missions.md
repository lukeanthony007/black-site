## 11. Mission Types (Contracts)

| Contract Type | Description | Typical Approach |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Extract** | Steal research package (data, prototype, scientist) and exfil | Stealth preferred |
| **Defend** | Protect a project/asset during an intrusion | Combat/containment |
| **Sabotage** | Corrupt data, plant device, poison process, cut power/network | Stealth or chaos |
| **Counter-Op** | Identify infiltrator, recover stolen material, restore logs | Investigation + combat |
| **Hostage/Rescue** | Secure personnel, negotiate or breach, extract alive | Mixed tactics |
| **Recon** | Map rings, tag cameras, capture shift schedule, steal credentials | Pure stealth |

Each contract provides:
- **Objective set** (primary + optional)
- **Constraints** (no kills / no alarms / time window)
- **Payout** (money + influence + intel)
- **Starting suspicion posture** (cold to hot)

**Contract Betrayal:** You can betray contracts mid-run. The game supports and accounts for this.
