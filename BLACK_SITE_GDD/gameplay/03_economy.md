## 6. Role Cost System

### Roles Cost Money

Every role has a **hiring cost** that comes out of your personal budget before a run. Expensive roles give better access and tools, but cheap roles can still steal secrets and profit.

| Role | Cost Tier | Base Cost | Risk/Reward | Stealing Potential |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Spy/Operative** | Elite | $$$$$ | High risk, high access, best tools | Highest (primary targets) |
| **Elite/CT** | Elite | $$$$ | Combat-focused, heavy gear | Medium (recovered intel) |
| **Hacker/IT** | Specialist | $$$ | System access, low combat | Very High (data exfil) |
| **Guard** | Standard | $$ | Weapons access, limited zones | Medium (security intel) |
| **Scientist** | Standard | $$ | Lab access, research intel | Very High (research data) |
| **Janitor** | Budget | $ | Wide access, invisible, no gear | High (sees everything) |
| **Civilian** | Budget | $ | Minimal access, ultimate cover | Low (but safest) |
| **Civilian/Contractor** | Budget | $ | Minimal access, ultimate cover |

### Cost Factors

| Factor | Effect on Cost |
|--------|----------------|
| Access level | Higher ring access = more expensive |
| Starting gear | Better loadout = more expensive |
| Traversal tier | Parkour/vent access = premium |
| Combat training | Weapon proficiency = premium |
| Intel package | Pre-mission knowledge = premium |

### Budget Strategy

**Expensive roles (Spy):**
- Start with best tools and access
- Can go anywhere, do anything
- High failure cost (lose investment)
- Best for direct assault or complex extraction
- **Steal the biggest prizes directly**

**Cheap roles (Janitor):**
- Minimal starting resources
- Must scavenge, improvise, social engineer
- Low failure cost (try again cheap)
- Best for patient, creative players
- **Steal through observation and opportunity**

**The economic insight:** A janitor who steals valuable research and sells it to China makes MORE than a spy who just completes their contract. The spy has higher potential but higher costs. The janitor has lower potential but near-zero costs and risk.

**Optimal strategy:** Start cheap, steal big, reinvest in better roles.

## 12. Resource Economy

### Overview

The economy has three layers:
1. **Role Cost** - Upfront investment to play a role (see Section 6)
2. **Personal Budget** - Persistent wallet across runs
3. **Operation Budget** - Per-mission spending

### Two Budget System

#### Personal Budget (Persistent Wallet)
- **Earned from:** Successful contracts, bonuses, resale of intel, side objectives
- **Spent on:** Long-term upgrades, equipment unlock access, safehouse services, mission spending top-ups

#### Operation Budget (Per-Run)
- **Source:** Base amount provided by contract/sponsor + personal budget top-up
- **Used for:** Gear, intel, support, placements

### Mission Spending Categories

#### Loadout Gear
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Weapons | Suppressed pistol, SMG, rifle, shotgun |
| Ammo | Standard, subsonic, armor-piercing |
| Armor | Light vest, heavy plate, stealth suit |
| Tools | Breaching kit, jammer, lockpick, disguise kit, zip ties, restraints |
| Medical | Medkits, stims |

#### Intel Purchases
- Partial facility layout
- Camera network map
- Keycard tier hints
- Shift schedule leak
- Target room location probability boost
- Patrol route timing

#### Support Options
- **Offsite Hacker** - Timed door/camera control windows
- **Second Operative** - Extra spy AI insertion (or co-op player)
- **QRF Backup** - Heavy, noisy, expensive combat support
- **Medic/Evac** - Emergency extraction assistance
- **Drone Recon** - Overhead surveillance

#### Placements (Pre-Positioned Caches)
- Weapon crate in service closet
- Ammo/armor cache near planned choke
- Escape kit in vents
- Vehicle positioned for exfil
- "Run-and-gun" stash options

### The Cost of Violence

Run-and-gun gameplay is viable but expensive:

| Cost Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Ammo, explosives, armor wear, medical supplies |
| **Operational** | Bribes, falsified logs, cleanup, forged IDs, exfil reroutes |
| **Exposure** | More heat, stronger future counterintelligence, harder facilities |
| **Sponsor** | Contract penalties for collateral; reduced payouts if messy |
