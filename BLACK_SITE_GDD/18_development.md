# Development Plan

Vertical slice scope and phase milestones.

---

## 30. First Vertical Slice

**Goal:** Prove the entire pitch with minimal scope.

### Scope

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Archetype | Research Facility |
| Nation variants | RU/US/CN doctrine skins |
| Contracts | Foreign extraction, Defense/intervention |

### Systems Included

- [x] Procedural facility with vents + rings + required rooms
- [x] SecurityNet (cameras/doors/logs/lockdown/terminals)
- [x] OpsGraph (guards/scientists/IT/janitors running jobs)
- [x] Stealth + suppressed weapons + automatic takedowns
- [x] Threat+Demand coercion
- [x] Continuous escalation to CT intervention
- [x] Personal budget + operation budget + placements
- [x] Campaign ledger updating national tech
- [x] **Role cost system** (spy expensive, janitor cheap)
- [x] **Disguise system** (Hitman-style social stealth)
- [x] **Gadget loadouts** (Dishonored-style creative tools)
- [x] **Alert phases** (MGS-style escalation states)
- [x] **Role-specific gameplay loops** (every role is fun)
