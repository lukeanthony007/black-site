# Core Game Loop
## 4. Game Loop

### The Core: Secrets Economy

**The whole game is stealing and trading research.** Whether you're a scientist, hacker, guard, or spy—you're participating in the same economy. Work legitimately for steady pay, or steal secrets and sell to rivals for 10x the profit.

### Per-Run Loop

1. **Choose a Role** - Pay the role cost from your budget (spy expensive, janitor cheap)
2. **Choose a Contract** - Extract, defend, sabotage, counter-op, rescue, or recon
3. **Configure Operation** - Allocate loadout, intel, support, and placements via budget
4. **Insert** - Enter a generated facility with active jobs, security net, and SOPs running
5. **Execute** - Complete objectives using stealth, coercion, or violence
6. **Steal (Optional)** - Acquire secrets during mission regardless of your official role
7. **Escalate or Escape** - Handle detection and survive escalation, or exfil clean
8. **Sell (Optional)** - Trade stolen secrets to rival nations for bonus income
9. **Outcome** - Intel gained/lost, casualties, evidence, heat, research progress, finances updated

### Campaign Loop (Arms Race)

1. Three nations evolve across missions based on your actions
2. Your choices transfer, deny, or corrupt research
3. Nations adapt with better sensors, response times, facility rings, and new tech
4. New perks and weapons appear in future runs based on global state
5. **Your wealth grows** - Afford better roles, gear, and support
6. **Role traversal** - Climb from janitor to spy as your funds increase

## 5. Player Identity

You are a **free-agent operator** with no permanent allegiance. Your loyalty is to your bank account.

**The fundamental truth:** Working for one side earns money. Stealing secrets and selling to Russia, China, or the US pays MORE. Every role can participate in this economy.

**You can:**
- Contract with Russia, US, China, or third parties
- Work legitimately and earn your salary (slow, safe)
- Steal secrets while "doing your job" (fast, risky)
- Sell to whoever pays most
- Play nations against each other
- Betray anyone at any time

**Example progression:**
1. Start as janitor (cheap role) for Russia
2. Do your job, earn salary, observe facility
3. Steal research data while "cleaning" the lab
4. Sell it to China (pays 10x your salary)
5. Afford guard role next run
6. Guard a US facility, steal their secrets too
7. Eventually afford spy role
8. Major heist, retire rich

**Nations respond through:**
- Doctrine changes (more surveillance, tighter access)
- Better QRF/elite response
- Counterintelligence improvements
- Research advancement or setback
- **Putting a price on YOUR head** (if you betray too openly)
