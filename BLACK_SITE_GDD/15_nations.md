## 24. Nations and Doctrine

### Russia

| Aspect | Characteristic |
|--------|----------------|
| Physical security | Heavy rings, chokepoints, hardened doors |
| Response | Strong lockdown, slower but heavy response |
| Infrastructure | Soviet-era mixed with modern overlays |
| Culture | Paper/badge heavy, credentials matter |
| Containment | Dense guard presence in key rings |

### United States

| Aspect | Characteristic |
|--------|----------------|
| Procedures | Standardized SOPs, clear signage |
| Response | Fast external intervention, disciplined CQB |
| Evidence | Strong logging, body cams, audit trails |
| Access | Consistent systems across facilities |
| Negotiation | Strong protocols before breach |

### China

| Aspect | Characteristic |
|--------|----------------|
| Surveillance | Dense camera coverage, digital control |
| Response | Rapid system-driven containment |
| Detection | Sensor-driven, IT-heavy |
| Counterintel | Bait terminals, honey logs, tracking |
| Lockdown | Automatic door/camera coordination |

**As nations advance, these traits intensify.**

## 25. Arms Race Campaign

### Research Outputs (Unlocks)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Weapons | New guns, suppressors, ammo types |
| Armor | Vests, helmets, stealth suits |
| Gadgets | Jammers, spoofers, drones |
| Surveillance | Better cameras, sensors, tracking |
| Countermeasures | Anti-surveillance tech |
| Response | Faster QRF, smarter AI, better pursuit |
| Facilities | More rings, better mantraps, secure terminals |

### How You Influence Progress

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Steal secrets** | Transfer, sell, or deny research |
| **Defend research** | Accelerate and harden a branch |
| **Sabotage** | Delay, corrupt, set back progress |
| **Cause incidents** | Forces doctrine changes |
| **Capture/kill staff** | Slow branch but increase security |

### Campaign Progression

**Over time, facilities evolve based on global state:**

| Nation State | Facility Characteristics |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Strong** | Fortresses, better tech, smart ops |
| **Weak** | Brittle, desperate, corrupt (insider opportunities) |
| **Unstable** | Unpredictable responses, security gaps |

### Win Conditions (Optional)

- One nation reaches tech dominance threshold
- World hits crisis threshold (too much sabotage)
- Operator completes endgame goal:
  - Become kingmaker
  - Destabilize all nations
  - Crown a specific winner

**Your freedom is the point: you can push a winner or keep everyone unstable.**
