# PART I: OVERVIEW

## 1. High Concept

**Title:** BLACK SITE

**One-Sentence Pitch:**
A first-person procedural facility sim-action game where Russian, Chinese, and American research sites generate from realistic schemas and run autonomously—guards patrol, scientists work, IT monitors cameras—while you play a loyalty-free operator who can infiltrate, defend, sabotage, and double-cross any side; each mission can flip from silent spycraft into full counter-terror intervention in seconds, and your choices drive an evolving global arms race that unlocks new tech, doctrines, and facility behaviors.

**The Fantasy:**
You enter an operating black site, not a "level." The facility already has a chain of command, shifts, routines, procedures, modern security systems, and people doing real work. You can spawn into any operation as a spy extracting secrets, a defender holding the line, an insider with access, a hacker manipulating systems, an insurgent initiating a takeover, or a CT/SWAT force neutralizing threats. But you are not loyal—you can serve one nation today and sabotage them tomorrow.

**Primary Inspirations:**
- GoldenEye 007 (N64) - facility layouts, spy fantasy
- Counter-Strike - gunfeel, tactical tension
- Mirror's Edge - parkour movement
- GunZ: The Duel / Max Payne - dive-roll shooting, style combat
- Streets of Rogue - procedural generation, autonomous NPCs, job systems
- GTA - believable civilian AI behavior
- Hitman - social stealth, disguises, sandbox assassination, multiple approaches
- Dishonored - gadget variety, creative problem-solving, multiple paths, emergent gameplay
- Metal Gear Solid - tactical espionage, alert phases, environmental interaction, codec/intel systems

**Genre Classification:** Immersive Sim / Stealth-Action / Tactical Shooter

## 2. Design Pillars

1. **Operating Facility, Not a Level:** Jobs and security run continuously. NPCs are mid-shift when you arrive.

2. **Procedural Realism:** Generated layouts are believable with security rings, staff routes, service routes, bathrooms, offices, and labs following real-world adjacency logic.

3. **Stealth ↔ Intervention Flip:** Quiet infiltration can become a live hostage/CT event instantly. No rounds, no resets.

4. **No Crosshair Discipline:** CS-like recoil/spread and movement penalties define shooting mastery.

5. **Parkour Advantage:** Mirror's Edge traversal + dive-roll shooting creates unique approach options.

6. **Two-Hand Freedom:** Dual wield weapons with independent per-hand actions.

7. **Gesture Melee:** Mouse-swing combat for punches, gun-bashes, and blade attacks.

8. **Threat + Demand:** "Open the door / hack the terminal or I'll shoot" works systematically for AI and players.

9. **Arms Race Campaign:** National research changes equipment, AI doctrine, and facility security over time.

10. **Player-Funded Escalation:** Your personal budget can buy heavier gear/support mid-run, at increasing financial and exposure cost.

11. **Immersive Sim Philosophy:** Every role is a complete gameplay experience. Playing as a janitor, scientist, or guard should be as engaging as playing spy—just different. Multiple solutions to every problem.

12. **Role Economy:** Roles cost money to hire. Spy is expensive and high-risk/high-reward. Guard is cheap but limited. Every role has unique value.

## 3. Setting Scope

**No cities in initial release.** Focus exclusively on modular facilities and linear setpieces:

- Research Facility (GoldenEye-style)
- Bunker
- Silo / Nuclear Site
- Chemical Plant
- Cyber / Archives
- Train / Convoy
- Boat / Frigate

Each facility type is generated from schemas, not handcrafted maps. The setting spans three superpowers: **Russia**, **United States**, and **China**.
