# Social Stealth & Disguises

Hitman-style social stealth mechanics.

---

## 8. Disguise System (Hitman-Style)

### Social Stealth

**You are who you appear to be.** Uniforms and credentials determine how NPCs react to you.

### Disguise Mechanics

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Uniform** | Determines visual identity |
| **Badge/Credentials** | Determines system access |
| **Behavior** | Determines suspicion level |

### Acquiring Disguises

| Method | Risk | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Takedown + strip | Medium | Body must be hidden |
| Find in locker/storage | Low | Limited options |
| Purchase (pre-mission) | None | Costs budget |
| Coerce NPC to surrender | High | Noisy, memorable |

### Disguise Effectiveness

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Matching zone** | Guard uniform works in guard areas |
| **Rank appropriate** | Low-rank disguise suspicious in high-security |
| **Witnesses** | NPCs who saw you change will recognize you |
| **Enforcers** | Some NPCs see through disguises (supervisors, security chiefs) |

### Suspicious Actions (While Disguised)

| Action | Suspicion Level |
|--------|-----------------|
| Being in wrong zone for role | Medium |
| Running (when role shouldn't) | Low |
| Carrying wrong items for role | Medium |
| Entering restricted areas | High |
| Interacting with systems you shouldn't | High |
| Being seen by "enforcer" NPCs | Immediate |

### Enforcer System

**Enforcers** are NPCs who can see through specific disguises:

| Disguise | Enforcers |
|----------|-----------|
| Guard | Other guards (same shift), security chief |
| Scientist | Lab director, fellow researchers |
| IT | Sysadmin, IT manager |
| Janitor | Facilities supervisor |

**Avoiding enforcers** becomes a puzzle layer on top of navigation.
